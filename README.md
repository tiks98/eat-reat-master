My Project is a Food Ordering and Delivering app where user can order from selected dishes and add them to cart, the user can delete a dish according to their preferences. 
Then user have to pay and select whether they want to deliver the order to their house or do they want to pick up the order from restaurant.

I'm going to be using Kotlin, and may be Google Map API for delivery page.
