My Project is a Food Ordering and Delivering app where user can order from selected dishes and add them to cart, the user can delete a dish according to their preferences.
Then user have to pay and select whether they want to deliver the order to their house or do they want to pick up the order from restaurant.

I'm going to be using Kotlin, and may be Google Map API for delivery page.

The user have to login through the FirebaseUI SignIn page and then after successful authentication they can browse the main application.
On Main Page there is range of food items to choose from and add it to your cart. User can order more quantity if they want.
User can also add there address into their profile and can also see previously entered address.
On Checkout the user have to choose the address they want their order to be delivered and they will get an confirmation of Total Price and their address.
